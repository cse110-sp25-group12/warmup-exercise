       * Viewport meta tag
       * Page title
       * Link to CSS file in styles/main.css -->

<!-- 2. Body Structure

       * number-of-decks (default: 1)
       * id for accessing the shoe
     - <card-deck> element with:
       * id for accessing the deck
       * attributes for customization
     - <card-hand> element with:

<!-- 4. Notes:

     - Keep the HTML structure minimal and semantic
     - Let the Web Components handle most of the rendering
     - Ensure proper hierarchy for game elements -->
