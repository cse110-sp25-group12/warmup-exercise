/* CSS STYLING INSTRUCTIONS

 * - Set fixed width and height for cards (e.g., 100px x 150px)
 * - Add margins between cards
 * - Use position: relative for the card container
 * - Add perspective for 3D flip effect
 * - Include transition for smooth animation
 * - Create styles for suit symbols in different colors:
 *   * Hearts/Diamonds: red
 *   * Clubs/Spades: black

/* 2. Card Faces
 * - Style both front and back faces:
 *   * Use position: absolute to overlay them
 *   * Set width and height to 100%

 * - Back face:
 *   * Create a card back design
 *   * Apply rotateY(180deg) transform initially

/* 3. Flip Animation
 * - Create .flipped class that:
 *   * Applies rotateY(180deg) transform to the card
 *   * Ensures smooth transition with transition property

/* 4. Deck Layout
 * - Use flexbox or grid for responsive layout
 *   * flex-wrap: wrap to handle multiple rows
 *   * Center alignment
 *   * Set max-width to prevent cards from spreading too wide

 *   * Use perspective and 3D transforms for realism
 *   * Add slight rotation for better visibility
 * - Style the remaining cards indicator
 * - Add hover effects for the draw button
 * - Include transition for cards being drawn

/* 6. Card Hand Styling
 * - Create a semi-circular or fan layout for cards in hand
 * - Use transform: rotate() and transform-origin for fanning effect
 * - Implement proper z-index for overlapping cards

/* 7. Shuffle Button & Animation
 * - Style button with appropriate:
 *   * Padding and margins
 *   * Background and text colors
 *   * Hover effects
 *   * Cursor: pointer
 * - Position button above or below the deck
 * - Create keyframes for shuffle animation
